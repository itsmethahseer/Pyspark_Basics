# Pyspark_Basics

## Overview

Pyspark_Basics is a project that introduces the basic operations performed on Pyspark dataframes. While Pandas is a popular library for data manipulation, Pyspark is preferred for larger datasets due to its distributed computing capabilities. This project aims to demonstrate the power of Pyspark in preprocessing large datasets for efficient data analysis.

## Installation

To use Pyspark_Basics, you need to install Pyspark and ensure you have a compatible version of Java:

```bash
pip install pyspark
```

## Project Structure

The project includes the following files:

- `Pyspark.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the basic operations on Pyspark dataframes.

## Usage

Follow these steps to get started with Pyspark_Basics:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure Pyspark is installed using the command mentioned in the Installation section.

3. Open the `Pyspark.ipynb` notebook to explore the basic operations on Pyspark dataframes.

## Features

The project showcases the following key features:

1. Loading and preprocessing large datasets using Pyspark dataframes.

2. Performing data manipulation, filtering, and aggregations efficiently on large datasets.

3. Leveraging distributed computing capabilities of Pyspark for improved performance.

## Dataset Size Considerations

While Pandas is an excellent library for smaller datasets, Pyspark shines when dealing with larger datasets that cannot fit into memory. For data analysis on substantial datasets, Pyspark's distributed computing offers significant advantages over traditional single-node approaches.
